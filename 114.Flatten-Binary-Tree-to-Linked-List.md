## description
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
 

Example 1:

![demo](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/flaten.jpg)

Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]


## Contraints
1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
2. -100 <= Node.val <= 100


## solution
The first solution come up to my mind is using recursion, and flatten subtrees for current node

```
var flatten = function(root) {
    if (!root) return root;
    if (!root.left && !root.right) {
        return root;
    }

    let right = root.right;
    let copyRoot = root;
    if (copyRoot.left) {
        copyRoot.right = flatten(root.left);
        copyRoot.left = null;
        while(copyRoot.right) {
            copyRoot = copyRoot.right;
        }
    }

    if (right) {
        copyRoot.right = flatten(right);
    }

    return root;
};
```

### time complexity: O(n)
### space complexity: O(n*n)

notice: 
- The time complexity of recursion is Number of recursions * time complexity of each recursion
- The space complexity of recursion is the space complexity of each recursion * recursive depth



## Follow up
### O(n) time complexity
Since pre-order traversal is normally "node, left, right", we'll have to move in the reverse order of "right, left, node".

Binary tree traversal is prime ground for a recursive solution, so let's define a helper (traverse) for the purpose. We'll also keep a global variable prev to keep track of the head of the linked list as we work our way backwards.

```
var flatten = function(root) {

    let prev = null; // cur

    let traverse = function (tree) {
        if (!tree) return null;

        traverse(tree.right)
        traverse(tree.left)

        tree.right = prev;
        tree.left = null;
        prev = tree;
    }

    traverse(root)
}

```

#### time complexity: O(n)
#### space complexity: O(n*n)

### Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?
In order to complete this solution in O(1) space, we won't be able to conveniently backtrack via a stack, so the key to this solution will be to retreat all the way back up to the root each time we reach a leaf. This will push the time complexity to O(N^2).

```
var flatten = function(root) {
    let head = null, curr = root;

    while(head !== root) {
        if (curr.right === head) curr.right = null;
        if (curr.left === head) curr.left = null;

        if (curr.right) curr = curr.right;
        else if (curr.left) curr = curr.left;
        else curr.right = head, head = curr, curr = root
    }

}
```
